In order to achieve such low energy consumption, unlike many other mobile devices, the BoatOfficer Blue does not continually communicate with the network.<br><br>Communication is driven purely by the device, i.e. it is not possible to contact the device at any particular time (e.g. to change settings). The only times that the device is listening to the network for commands is just after it has send a message to the network. Therefore, if you change the settings of the device in the app, they will not be sent immediately, but, it is necessary to wait for the BoatOfficer Blue to sent a message to create the opportunity to transmit the changes to the device settings. This is indicated in the app when making a change of settings.<br><br>The coverage of the LoRaWAN network of TheThingsNetwork can be checked on ttnmapper.org or by pressing the button on the BoatOfficer Blue (see chapter \"LED indicators\").",

This is an integrated self-protection. Please contact BoatOfficer Service for assistance.<br><br>Keep the BoatOfficer as dry as possible. <br><br>The housing of the BoatOfficer Blue tolerates splash water and short submersion. However, avoid this if possible, so that no moisture can get into the housing permanently.",
